justcutit - frame-precision MPEG TS cutter
==========================================

justcutit consists of two applications:
 - justcutit_editor: Provides a Qt4-based GUI to inspect
   MPEG TS files and generate a cutlist file
 - justcutit (located in core/): Performs the actual work

The cutting is performed through re-encoding the parts
around the cutpoints (just a few GOPs). Everything else is just
copied with modified timestamps as required.

Supported stream types/codecs:
 - MPEG-2 video
 - AC3 audio
 - more to come: H.264, MP2 audio, etc

ffmpeg's libavformat/libavcodec are used for demuxing & decoding.

Running the editor & cutter
==========================================

The editor currently needs its OpenGL shader source code
in its directory. If you're doing an out-of-source build
please symlink all *.glsl files.

TODO/known limitations:
==========================================
 - The editor uses OpenGL acceleration to display YUV420 images.
   Other image formats or systems without OpenGL are not supported.
 - Everything should run on Windows, but the cmake files need some
   work.
 - Had limited sample files to play with. SD quality recordings from
   an Kathrein UFS-910 work fine here.
 - Could support more output formats than MPEG-TS
